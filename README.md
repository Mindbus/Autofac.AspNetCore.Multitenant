## Why Use This?

ASP.NET Core default `RequestServicesContainerMiddleware` is where the per-request lifetime scope usually gets generated. However, [its constructor is where it wants the `IServiceScopeFactory`](https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting/blob/b6a3fee08869cd9ac9d266b15b4eb7de205199ed/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting/Internal/RequestServicesContainerMiddleware.cs#L17) that will be used later during the request to create the request lifetime scope.

Unfortunately, that means the `IServiceScopeFactory` is created/resolved at the point when the request comes in, long before an `HttpContext` is set in any `IHttpContextAccessor`. The result is the scope factory ends up coming from the default tenant scope, before a tenant can be identified, and per-request services will later all come from the default tenant. Multitenancy fails.

This package provides a different request services middleware that ensures the `IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext` is set and defers creation of the request lifetime scope until as late as possible so anything needed for tenant identification can be established.
